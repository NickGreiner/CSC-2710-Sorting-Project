# The Assignment

Sorting is fundamental to implementing solutions in a wide range of problem spaces. I would like for you to work in teams of four and implement six sorting algorithms: selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort and heapsort. In cases where including a Boolean issorted variable will improve performance, please do so. I would like for you to generate large datasets to test your algorithms. You can use a random number function to create a dataset or there are many sample sets available online. I would like for you to test with four types of datasets: almost sorted, randomly distributed, reverse sorted and sets with many duplicates. I would like for you to measure the time and number of basic operations (compares) each algorithm takes to sort each dataset.

# Team Based Work

Working in teams is the norm in almost all work environments. Part of the assignment will be managing the strengths and weaknesses that are going to be part of any team. At the end of the project, each team member will be asked to anonymously assign each of their team members a rating and review. This peer review will be a portion of each student’s final grade for the project.

# Presenting the Work

Another aspect of programing that will be encountered in a work environment is the need to present work and programmatic solutions to complex problems to supervisors and peers. Often times the main visibility you will have to high level supervisors where you work is when you are presenting a project you have completed. This is a chance for you to shine and get noticed for career advancement. Being an effective presenter is also an important skill when multiple teams need to coordinate.

Each team member will be responsible for presenting a portion of the project. The presentations will require three parts with one of the three team members being responsible for each of the three parts.

# At a minimum, your presentation should include these three sections:

 (1) A description of your teams’ approach to the assignment. Your presentation should present your results and summarize what your team learned about the various sorting.

 (2) A presentation and walkthrough of the code that was written by the team.

 (3) A final analysis of the success of the team’s approach and results. If the team’s program failed why did it do so. In computer science, it is quite normal for an attempted solution to fail to fully achieved the targeted goals. Some of the most successful software ever created has been built on the foundation of a few previous failed attempts where teams tried a solution and failed, but they gained valuable knowledge into why a certain approach will not work.

# Written Report

The final portion of this assignment will be a brief written report from each student of your team’s work that will describe and analyze material similar to what was presented in the team’s presentations. This ia not a team report but an individual one. One to two pages will be sufficient, but there is no limit. You should include a description of what were your personal contributions to the project. Again, this is a very important skill for all of you to develop. Often times hugely important decisions such as whether you are given a large project or whether your current project is cancelled will hinge entirely on the final decision that is made by a division head, where the only contact you will have is through a report you have written.
